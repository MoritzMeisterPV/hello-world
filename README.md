Hey Guys,

My name is Moritz Meister and I am working for Pfeiffer Vacuum as a Market Manager. Besides that I am making my Masters degeree in process management at the THM in Wetzlar. Currently I am working on a project to control our vacuum pumps via mobile devices. We are trying to make our pumps smarter and prepare them for the digitization. Our project is presented on the following page: 

If you are working with vacuum pumps and you want to participate in developing smart control panels, feel free to get our software and check it out!

Hope to hear from you,
Moritz
